# UNDER SLOW DEVELOMPENT, NOTHING INTERESTING YET
I may give up or finish this project one day. However I made a simplified version of it once in python and thought that it can be a nice project to learn something new and to create something useful for my self and anyone in the itnernet.
Wish me good luck and time for the project ;)
